							<p>E-License is a website service to simplify Belize's Traffic Department industry. This website allows access to regular users as well as traffic officers.
                               Our mission is to create a website that allows near complete digitization of both a user's license information and log traffic offenses. Through this 
                               website regular users will be able to view their license information, view pending tickets (if applicable), and make payments towards tickets
                               or for a license renewal.
                            </p>
